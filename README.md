# Ecommerce-Site
A fully functional Ecommerce Site. I was tasked with developing a site where all the data was dynamically taken from a mySQL database that I setup.
On checkout the users order is uploaded to a new table called orders.

The design was based around a brand standards guideline that was given to the students.
